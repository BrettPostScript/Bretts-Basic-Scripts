# Bretts-Basic-Scripts
Basic C# Scripts for Simple Unity Games

I created this pack of basic scripts as part of a learning resource for a class I teach.
These scripts are designed to fit a variety of uses and implementations and serve as a
starting point for making a game in Unity.

These scripts are designed to work with Unity 2020, but have also been tested in Unity 2018.
The example project is made with the 2020 version of Unity, so that version is the
most compatable.

You can either implement the individual code files as you see fit, or import the
Unity package directly into your project.
